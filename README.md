# About
This webapp was designed and developed to be an intuitive, modern and fun way to search and check your favorite Pok√©mon info, stats and movesets by gathering and displaying most recent data from Pok√©API. This is a personal project developed by [tvc95](https://github.com/tvc95/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Webapp
You can access the webapp by clicking [here](https://pokedex-tvc95.netlify.app/).

# Layout
The application layout was made with Figma. It was inspired from the games (most notably [Pok√©mon HG/SS Pok√©dex](https://serebii.net/heartgoldsoulsilver/pokedex.png) color scheme) and made with Material design in mind.
